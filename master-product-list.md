- **Focus on eczema/sensitive skin** aligns with chronic condition intelligence strategy
- **Mix of sizes** allows tracking both value (large tubs) and trial/travel (small tubes)
- **Good brand diversity** prevents over-indexing on single manufacturer pricing
- **Lactic acid products separate** because they're specialty exfoliating formulas
- **Pataday included** extends beyond skincare into allergy management

## NEXT STEPS

1. Decide if you want to add the 4 recommended products (CeraVe, Vanicream, Cetaphil, Aveeno)
2. Choose 3-4 retailers to track
3. Build/configure scrapers for those retailers
4. Set up daily automated checks
5. Let data accumulate for 3-6 months
6. Analyze patterns and share insights in communities

**Remember:** Start small, prove the concept works, then expand. 12 products is plenty for learning what works!
